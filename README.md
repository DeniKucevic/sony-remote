# Sony remote control

Sony remote control is a Capacitor app that can be used to control SONY - BRAVIA TVs on local network.
App is made utilizing API documentation found here: https://pro-bravia.sony.net/develop/

## Description

App can be used on Android and IOS, there is no support for web control since I couldn't figure out a good way to find a TV on the local network from web browser. The only way would be to enter the IP address manualy and I think that would be too technical for most users. I might add support for that after I figure out a better way to connect to the TV from the Capacitor app. Capacitor was paired with React and Ionic UI. This is a passion project of mine since when I needed some app to control the TV I could not found single one that was not riddled with ADs and that really annoyed me. Since this is a passion project I can only guarantee that there will be no ADs in the app ðŸ˜Ž, Code is free and open source, if you want to contribute feel free to open a PR and I will update app stores and contributors on this page. Suggestions, ideas and advices are welcome ðŸ˜Š.
